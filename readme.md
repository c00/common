# Common
A mini framework for common challenges such as database querying, 
dependency injection and date manipulation.

This is simply a personal usage toolkit that exists here for 2 reasons:
* So I can easily import it in my future projects with Composer
* To show potential employers code samples.

On the latter, not everything has been unit tested, but see the Query 
Builder for examples of what I consider decent code. It's by no means 
a complete query builder that supports all dialects and all features,
but it does the basic CRUD stuff, including joins. 

##Documentation
Is not really available. But feel free to send me messages and I might 
add some prose along the way.
